# food-ordering-system-in-python
The businesses in restaurants are growing constantly.  At the same time, the need for managing its operations and tasks arises.  The best way to optimize these activities is growing   the business online as well. With the improvement of technology, online food ordering systems are becoming a popular topic. 
I wanted to make a simple code in which I could implement all the main and required topics. So, I chose Restaurant Management/Online food ordering system. 
The project “Restaurant Management System” is implemented to reduce the manual work and enhances the accuracy of work in a restaurant. 
This project was allotted to me during my first semester in Python. I am confident that I will continue to leverage this foundation to undertake and excel in more sophisticated projects in the future
